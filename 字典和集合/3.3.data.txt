What's New
It is powered by the PyTorch deep learning framework.
Includes more features such as panoptic segmentation, densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, etc.
Can be used as a library to support different projects on top of it. We'll open source more research projects in this way.
It trains much faster.
See our blog post to see more demos and learn about detectron2.

Installation
See INSTALL.md.

Quick Start
See GETTING_STARTED.md, or the Colab Notebook.

Learn more at our documentation. And see projects/ for some projects that are built on top of detectron2.

Model Zoo and Baselines
We provide a large set of baseline results and trained models available for download in the Detectron2 Model Zoo.

License
Detectron2 is released under the Apache 2.0 license.
